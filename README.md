# Overview
This project includes the code developed in the scope of my [master thesis](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1221560/FULLTEXT01.pdf) in Systems, Control and Robotics at KTH Stockholm. 

## Abstract
Printed circuit boards used in most ordinary electrical devices are usually equipped through an assembly line. Pick and place machines as part of those lines require accurate detection of incorrectly picked components, and this is commonly performed via image analysis. The goal of this project is to investigate if we can achieve state-of-the-art performance in an industrial quality assurance task through the application of artificial neural networks. Experiments regarding different network architectures and data modifications are conducted to achieve precise image classification. Although the classification rates do not surpass or equal the rates of the existing vision-based detection system, there remains great potential in the deployment of a machine-learning-based algorithm into pick and place machines.

# Disclaimer
The project was never intended to be collaborative, hence the code lacks meaningful variable names, misses fully comment coverage, and was not planed with posterior considerations on a clear software architecture.
